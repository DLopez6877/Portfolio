      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I am from Vancouver, Washington. I recently left my job as an in-home Installation and Repair Technician for <span class="emplyer">Comcast</span>. Before that I worked in the printing Industry as <span class="employer">DocuMart</span>. During that time, I served part of my 8 years in the <span class="employer">Washington Army National Guard</span> where I was a Signal Support Systems Specialist working in the field as part of a field artillery unit. The first half of my service I was also attending college classes at <span class="employer">Clark College</span>.

      <h2>Why I started class at Epicodus</h2>
      <p>
        I started class with little to no experience in coding. Every job I have ever held had been in some sort of field that would require me to be on my feet all day and far away from computers. However, I have always been passionate about computers and always wanted to learn as much as I could about them. Over the years I had dabbled with coding during my freetime but never much more than just edditing a MySpace page or learning a tid bit here and there from a friend. One day my roommate jokingly asked me if I wanted to quit my job and go to a coding bootcamp with him. At first I jokingly laughed right back and said, "yea right" but after a while I thought about it more and realised that's exactly what I want to do. I saved up money for months, applied to Epicodus, and <span class="here">here I am!</span>

      <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>

          <p>
            I mostly enjoy hanging out with friends and family. My girlfriend is a big part of my life and I spend most of my freetime with her. Aside from those, the things I enjoy the most are watching soccer, playing video games, and going out to eat.
